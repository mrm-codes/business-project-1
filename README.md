# business-project-1

##Introduction
My name is Mario Matundulo, an aspirant software engineer, currently studying at Ed2go academy.
As part of my program, I build a business website, a cafe, as a representation of a local business owener who wants its business to reac more customers and be user-friendly for actual and future customers. This project is to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS and GitHub when working with project. I believe there's a lot to be done, but this is what I could do with the knowledge that I have.

##Project Description
This project encompasses,a local business being incorporated into a website, that allows user to navegate to menus, business events and it has more information about the business. Through the website, users can not only have access in what the business offer, but they also are able to make reservations. 

##How to Use it?
1. You can access the website with this ####link:
2. Use your mouse or fingertips to navegate through the page.
3. In the home page you can find navegation menu on the top that can take you to where service that interests you. On the bottom you'll find the same links, in case you need them.
4. The navegation menu, contains the business logo, home, menu, events, business information (about) and button to make a reservation. Each item on the navegation menu has your actions. For example, the Logo and home, takes you to initial page wherever you are. The menu, events and about, takes you to its respective pages. The "make a reservation button" provides you a form with details of your reservation, such as your name, contact, day and time, and extra notes if you have one.
